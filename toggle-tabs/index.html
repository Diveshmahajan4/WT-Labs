                <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> A
                programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which
                can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of
                procedures.

                Singleton, Observer, and Factory patterns.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Software Architecture:</strong> The high-level structure
                of a software system, including components, relationships, and
                principles guiding its organization.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Development Methodologies:</strong> Approaches to
                software development that dictate how teams organize, plan, and
                execute their work. Examples include Agile, Waterfall, and

              Design thinking is a human-centered approach to problem-solving
              that emphasizes empathy, creativity, and collaboration. It
              provides a structured framework for tackling complex problems and
              generating innovative solutions. Key principles of design thinking
